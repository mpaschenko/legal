      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Water Tracker</strong> (“the App”) handles information.
        We designed the App to be simple and privacy-friendly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We do not sell your personal data.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>We do not share personal data for advertising or marketing purposes.</strong></li>
      <li>The App primarily works with <strong>data stored on your device</strong>.</li>
      <li>We may collect <strong>anonymous technical data</strong> for analytics and crash reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information the App Processes</h2>
    <p>The App may process the following information to provide its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hydration entries</strong> (e.g., water intake amount, time of logging).</li>
      <li><strong>App settings</strong> (e.g., daily goal, reminder preferences, measurement units).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Anonymous Analytics & Crash Reports</h2>
    <p>
      To improve stability, performance, and user experience, the App may collect
      <strong>anonymous and aggregated usage data</strong> and <strong>crash logs</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data may include information such as app version, device model, operating system version,
      and technical error details. It does <strong>not</strong> include information that directly identifies you,
      such as your name, email address, or precise location.
    </p>
    <p>
      These data are used solely to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Diagnose and fix crashes and technical issues</li>
      <li>Understand general app usage patterns</li>
      <li>Improve app features and performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not require account registration and does not request personal identifiers
      such as your name, address, or phone number to function.
    </p>

    <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>
      Hydration data and settings are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
      Anonymous analytics and crash information may be processed by third-party services
      used for app diagnostics and analytics.
    </p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable reminders, the App may send notifications to help you remember to drink water.
      Notification scheduling and delivery are handled by your device’s operating system.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may use trusted third-party services (such as analytics or crash reporting tools)
      to process anonymous technical data. These services are used strictly to maintain
      and improve the App and are not used for targeted advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third-party services process data in accordance with their own privacy policies
      and applicable data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age of 13.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect information processed by the App.
      While no system is completely secure, we aim to minimize data collection
      and limit processing to what is necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can manage or delete hydration entries within the App (if available).</li>
      <li>You can disable notifications in the App or device settings.</li>
      <li>You can uninstall the App to remove locally stored data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      If you are located in the EEA or UK, you may have rights under GDPR,
      including the right to access or delete data. Since most data is stored locally
      or processed anonymously, many controls are available directly in the App or device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
